> _A hand-picked collection of the finest of resources for the most awesome of agents, [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/), the undisputed champion of coding companions, from the unstoppable team at [Anthropic PBC](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code).

> The current iteration of the list, such as you see it today, was launched with the express intent to highlight resources that were _not_ on the last iteration, and in particular to make selections from the list of recommendations. However, this is only temporary - resources will continue to be added over the coming weeks, and "legacy" resources will be migrated to the new format. So, if you had been featured on the list before, and you don't see your project now, that's the reason why - "legacy" resources that are still maintained and awesome will be added back in soon - _and_, in the meantime, they are also preserved (but will not be updated) in the [README_ALTERNATIVES](README_ALTERNATIVES/) directory.
